   - Process execution tracking (exec, fork, clone)
   - File access patterns (open, read, write)
   - Network socket operations
   - Capability and privilege changes

2. **Behavioral Analysis at Kernel Level**

   Monitored Patterns:
   - Unusual syscall sequences
   - Kernel exploit primitives (spray, UAF)
   - Container breakout attempts
   - Rootkit installation behaviors
   - Fileless malware execution
   ```

   - Network connection blocking
   - Container isolation/quarantine
   - Capability restriction
   - Resource limiting

### Unique eBPF/Isovalnt Capabilities

1. **Zero Overhead Monitoring**
   ```c
   // Example eBPF program structure
   SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_open")
   int trace_open(struct trace_event_raw_sys_enter* ctx) {
       // Capture file open attempts
       // Check against security policies
       // Alert or block if malicious
   }
   ```

2. **In-Kernel Policy Enforcement**

   - Prevent race conditions (TOCTTOU)
   - Immediate response (nanoseconds)

3. **Complete Observability**

   - Every syscall
   - Every file operation
   - Every process creation

4. **Container-Native Security**
