# Cisco Agentic AI SOC Demo

A comprehensive demonstration of AI-driven Security Operations Center (SOC) capabilities using collaborative AI agents.

## Overview

This demo showcases 16 advanced security scenarios demonstrating how multiple AI agents work together to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in real-time.

## Features

- **16 AI SOC Scenarios**: From lateral movement detection to source code security scanning
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: IO Agent, Master Reasoning Agent, and specialized security agents
- **MCP Integration**: Connect to real-world data sources via Model Context Protocol
- **Knowledge Graph**: Continuous learning and pattern recognition
- **Interactive UI**: Dark theme with realistic AI streaming responses
