# For Personal Access Token, go to: GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token (with 'repo' scope)

# Option 1: Direct push with credentials (one-time)
git push https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME:YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/ashmanpan/AIsocdemov1.git main

# Option 2: Set remote with credentials (permanent until changed)
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME:YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/ashmanpan/AIsocdemov1.git
git push -u origin main

# Option 3: If you have SSH key set up
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ashmanpan/AIsocdemov1.git
git push -u origin main

# After pushing, your repository will be available at:
# https://github.com/ashmanpan/AIsocdemov1

# AWS Amplify will then be able to access it for deployment
